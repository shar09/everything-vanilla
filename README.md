# everything-vanilla

Building small vanilla javascript applications to sharpen my skills and learn some cool new tricks.

Each project has it's own Readme which contains notes, functionality and resources unique to that application.

This project is built following Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 [course](https://javascript30.com/).

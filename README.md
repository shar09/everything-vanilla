# everything-vanilla

Building small vanilla javascript applications to sharpen my skills and learn some cool new tricks.

- Each project has it's own readme which contains notes, functionality and resources unique to that application.

- This project is being built following Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 [course](https://javascript30.com/).
